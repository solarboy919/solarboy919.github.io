    <p class="design-intro">The projects below have all been created during my time at Pittsburgh Technical College. They have been reworked in recent quarters to improve upon my designs with my most recent learned information to continue to grow and improve my design skills.</p>

            <h3>DB Design</h3>
            <p class="design-p">I made this brochure for DB Designs as a single piece to add to my portfolio to show my professional design skills in creating a brochure for a kitchen and bathroom remodel company. This piece flows with the company’s color scheme and branding. </p>

            <h3>Willi's</h3>
            <p class="design-p">The pieces created in Willi’s campaign 1 were each made pieces to add to Willi’s Ski and Snowboard shops corporate pieces. The logo was redesigned to be a more elegant color scheme and more appealing for the target audience. Stickers, a stationery package, and a corporate standards manual were created in this campaign. </p>

            <h3>The Dog Stop</h3>
            <p class="design-p">The newsletter I created for The Dog Stop is a unique piece in which I was able to incorporate original photography. The company had not had any newsletters previously and this would be a good addition to their existing advertisements. This piece shows my design skills learned.</p>

        <section class="container-design">
            <h3>Mondo Llama</h3>
            <p class="design-p">The Mondo Llama single piece is an important piece to have included in my portfolio because it shows my understanding of package design. I had the opportunity to make a mockup version of this in class to compare to the original packaging I redesigned from. Making sure that the package design has the right orientation when it is assembled is essential. I got to improve the original packaging design and show the skills learned. </p>

The pieces made for this are door hangers, a 4-page brochure, and B2B advertisements.  I had made sure that the pieces were compatible with the company's branding.</p>

            <h3>Zero Motors</h3>
            <p class="design-p">I am happy to have my Zero Motors single piece be apart of my portfolio. In this piece, I was able to show my typography and Photoshop skills. I enjoyed making this artistic design that encapsulates the company's marketing. </p>

            <h3>Hutto Veterinary</h3>
            <p class="design-p">The Hutto Veterinary Clinic campaign is very interesting. I got the opportunity to add original photography into one of the pieces. I added pieces that the company had not already have made. Making sure to use my design skills to create the best possible works of artwork. </p>

Mine is a travel guide to Okemo if the client is looking for an exciting place to have a business trip. This piece matches the branding of the company and is unique to the other marketing that they have already created.</p>
